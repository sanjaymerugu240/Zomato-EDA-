## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Zomato Restaurants Dataset** to uncover insights about restaurant ratings, cuisines, locations, and user preferences across different countries.  

The goal is to analyze and visualize restaurant-related data to understand key trends that impact restaurant performance and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw restaurant data  
- Explore relationships between **ratings**, **price range**, **votes**, and **location**
- Identify top cuisines and countries with the most listings  
- Visualize patterns using Python libraries  
- Prepare insights that could be used for **business strategy** or **machine learning modeling**
