 📚 Libraries Used in Zomato EDA Project

This document provides an overview of the Python libraries used in the **Zomato Data Analysis (EDA)** project — explaining their purpose and how they were applied in the notebook.


🐍 1. Python

- **Purpose:** Core programming language used for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.  
- **Usage:** Used to perform data cleaning, processing, plotting, and statistical analysis.


🧮 2. NumPy

- **Library:** `numpy`  
- **Purpose:** Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions.  
- **Usage in Project:**  
  - Basic numerical operations (mean, median, min, max)  
  - Data transformations and array handling  
  - Used indirectly in Pandas and Seaborn operations  

python
import numpy as np
🧾 3. Pandas
Library: pandas

Purpose: Data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Usage in Project:

Loading datasets from .csv and .xlsx files

Handling missing values and merging tables

Generating summary statistics and dataframes

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
📊 4. Matplotlib
Library: matplotlib.pyplot

Purpose: Basic 2D plotting library for Python.

Usage in Project:

Created bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs

Adjusted figure size and axis labels for better visualization

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
🎨 5. Seaborn
Library: seaborn

Purpose: High-level data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

Usage in Project:

Created heatmaps, boxplots, and countplots

Simplified statistical visualizations (correlation, distribution)

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
🧮 6. Scikit-learn (Optional if used)
Library: sklearn

Purpose: Machine Learning library for classification, regression, and model evaluation.

Usage in Project:

Used for calculating metrics (MSE, R²) during regression analysis

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
🧰 7. Jupyter Notebook
Tool: jupyter

Purpose: Interactive notebook environment for executing code, visualizations, and markdown notes.

Usage in Project:

Ran all analysis cells step-by-step

Combined code, visuals, and markdown documentation
